Q.	Check that the server with the 10.51.1.253 IP address is reachable from
	your computer.

A.	ping 10.51.1.253

#	ping tries to talk to the IP address. If communication is successful it
#	requests a ping back to measure the speed of communication. At least
#	that's how I think it works. Add -a for a good time
